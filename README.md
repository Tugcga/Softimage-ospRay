## What is it

This is very basic integration of the [ospRay](https://github.com/ospray/OSPRay) render engine into Softimage. The main goal of the project not only create integration of some third-party renderer into Softimage, but also to develop some universal template, which can be used for integrations of any other external renderer.

## What features are supported from Softimage

### Polygon mesh objects

If mesh contains uvs, then the renderer use only the first one. If mesh contains vertex colors, then the renderer also use only the first one. From geometry property the renderer use the following parameters

### Strands

<img src="imgs/render_strands.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

If pointcloud has non-empty ```StrandPosition``` attribute, then the renderer interpret this pointcloud as only strands object. It renders each strand as curve primitive. The following ICE-attributes are used: ```Color``` and ```Size```.

### Pointclouds

If pointcloud object does not contains strands, then the renderer try to interpet it as spheres, box or volume primitive. Each particle with shape ```Sphere``` form spheres primitive, with shape ```Box``` form boxes primitive (which always axis-aligned), with ```Point``` shape form particle volume primitive.

##### Spheres

<img src="imgs/render_spheres.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

Spheres primitive use ```Size``` and ```Color``` attributes for the radius and color respectively.

##### Boxes

<img src="imgs/render_boxes.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

Boxes primitive use ```Size``` and ```Color``` attributes for the box size and color respectively.

##### Particles Volume

<img src="imgs/render_volume.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

This primitive renders as an cloud of volume particles. Only ```Size``` attribute is affected. The color and density of volume can be defined with the help of ```OSP Build Transfer Function``` ICE-node. Also there is node ```OSP Isosurface``` which allows to convert the particle volumes into isosurface (something similar to metaballs).

### Light sources

The renderer understand all standard types of Softimage lights: point, spot and infinite. For these types of light the renderer use the following parameters

![Light properties](imgs/props_light.png)

If the light has active ```Area Light``` then it interpret as rectangular area light. The rendere use the following area light parameters

### HDR environment lights

There is possibility to use hdr-image as environment light. It can be added by usin Environment shader of the render pass. The renderer use the following parameters

![Environment light properties](imgs/props_hdr.png)

```Image``` parameter used for tweaking light intensity, ```X, Y, Z``` rotations used for rotation of the environment map.

### Camera

The renderer use the following parameters of the perspective Softimage camera

### Material previews

The renderer generate previews on Material Manager and in material previews. Preview of the shader nodes are not supported.

### Textures

The renderer understand standard Image shader node for texturing. It only one parameter for tiling

But you can change the image source with any effect (crop, blur, flip), and all of them will be effected on the renderer.

## What ospRay features are supported

* Three different renderers: ```sciVis```, ```AO``` and ```PathTracer```. You can switch between these render modes in render settings
* Convert volume particles into isosurface by using special ICE-node
* Use Ho≈°ek-Wilkie sky model as background light. It can be activated on render settings
* Motion blur. It can be activated and tweaked in render settings
* One rendering task can also save three additional render channels: albedo, depth and normal
* Path tracer renderer supports all materials. Most parameters (color or float) of these materials can be textured. SciVis and AO renderers supports only the simplest ```Obj``` material
* Depth of field. The amount of defocus can be controlled in render settings. The interest point of the camera define the focus point
* Panoramic camera


## What is not supported from ospRay

* Subdivision geometry primitive. Because Softmage has it's own subdivision functionality
* Planes primitive
* Some parameters of the light sources (for example ```intensityQuantity```, ```intensityDistribution``` or ```c0``` for spot light), because default Softimage lights does not contains any analogue of these parameters
* Denoising and tonemapping image operations
* Distributed rendering
* All types of volumes (except particle volume): Structured Regular Volume, Structured Spherical Volume, AMR Volume, Unstructured Volume and VDB Volume
* Volume textures
* Vector ```ior``` parameter in the Metal shader
* Texture transformations (except texture tiling)
* Stereo mode of the render camera
* Debug renderer


## How to compile addon

Sources contains all necessary libraries for compiling addon. Simply open solution in VisualStudio 2015, switch no ```Release``` profile, and all should be done successfully. Binary dll-s are in archive in release page.


## How to use for other integrations

This repository can be used for creating integrations of other renderers into Softimage. Delete the folder ```render_osp``` and you will obtain minimal universal integration of empty renderer. It contains the following features:
* Control all states of the render process
* Call update only for objects which changed between two render calls
* Save output image by using [stb_write](https://github.com/nothings/stb) and [tinyexr](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyexr) libraries

To integrate another render you should create the inheritance class of the ```RenderEngineBase``` class and implement the following virtual functions:
```
virtual XSI::CStatus render_option_define(XSI::CustomProperty &property);
virtual XSI::CStatus render_options_update(XSI::PPGEventContext &event_context);
virtual XSI::CStatus render_option_define_layout(XSI::Context &context);

virtual XSI::CStatus pre_render_engine();
virtual XSI::CStatus pre_scene_process();  
virtual XSI::CStatus create_scene();
virtual XSI::CStatus update_scene(XSI::X3DObject &xsi_object, const UpdateType update_type); 
virtual XSI::CStatus update_scene(const XSI::Material &xsi_material);
virtual XSI::CStatus update_scene(const XSI::SIObject &si_object, const UpdateType update_type);
virtual XSI::CStatus update_scene_render();
virtual void render();
virtual XSI::CStatus post_render_engine();
virtual void abort();
virtual void clear_engine();
```

See comments and example to understand what each function should do. Additionally you should change the name of the addon for all callbacks in ```si_callbacks\si_callbacks.cpp``` file (and also change the name in the main start-point file ```SoftimageOspRay.cpp```).
